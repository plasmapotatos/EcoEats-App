**A way to make eating healthy easy**

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run EcoEats on your local machine. 
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17rBQxJZ0F68wgZd4Is6krUJZ4x1IzeWB/view)'s a demo of the current prototype and explanation.
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VKf-BGwldbylcnRCxek1cZlQV4w-Oeft/view?usp=sharing)'s a short explanation of our code structure and organization.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development)
- A physical device or emulator

### Setup Flutter
1. Download and install Flutter from the [official site](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Add Flutter to your system path:
   ```sh
   export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
   ```
3. Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   flutter doctor
   ```
   Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

### Set Up an Emulator or Device
#### Android Emulator:
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Navigate to **AVD Manager** (Android Virtual Device Manager).
3. Create a new virtual device and start it.

#### iOS Simulator:
1. Open Xcode.
2. Navigate to **Simulator** via `Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Simulator`.

#### Physical Device:
1. Enable **Developer Mode** and **USB Debugging** (for Android) or **Enable Development Mode** (for iOS).
2. Connect your device via USB and run:
   ```sh
   flutter devices
   ```
   Ensure your device appears in the list.

### Run the App
To launch EcoEats, execute:
```sh
flutter run
```
This will build and deploy the app on the selected emulator or device.

Note that this step will only start up the app's UI. If you would like to also utilize the food scanning feature, please ensure that you have also started up the [EcoEats server](https://github.com/plasmapotatos/EcoEats-Server) and that it is running on the same LAN as the app. Apologizes for the hackiness of this solution but we didn't want to expose a port from our local server to the public, and the same functionality can be achieved as long as you VPN to the same network as your server, for example through [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/)'s custom certificate system.
